The potentials are local and static except that a different one is used for each state of distinct isotopic spin, total spin, and total angular momentum. It is found that neither the short-range behavior of the potentials nor the central-to-tensor ratio in the 3S1-3D1 state is well determined by the data. Present data do exclude potentials containing only local central, tensor, and spin-orbit terms. Addition of a quadratic spin-orbit potential such as that used by the Yale group or by Hamada and Johnston helps greatly but is probably not enough to completely reproduce the data. Nevertheless, present day theories which use potentials are not likely to be sensitive to failures due to use of this form."

abstract = {Nucleon-nucleon interactions obtained from several models for the field theoretic scattering amplitude are studied. The interaction includes contributions from one-pion and one-omega exchange and from two-pion exchange as calculated in a dispersion theory framework. The resulting interaction is regularized by a cut-off factor obtained by the eikonal approximation to multiple vector meson exchange processes. The Blankenbecler-Sugar equation is solved with the interaction and nucleon-nucleon scattering phase parameters are computed. For the best model good agreement with phenomenological phase parameters is achieved for physically reasonable values of the meson-nucleon coupling constants and the spectral functions needed for the evaluation of the two-pion exchange effects. The deuteron wave function is computed as are the deuteron charge and quadrupole form factors. The interaction is shown to have significantly weaker short-range repulsion than commonly found in local phenomenological potentials and in one-boson exchange models.}

abstract={Introduction. In recent experiments, it has M. been shown that charged mesons, brought to rest A in photographic emulsions, sometimes lead to the production of secondary mesons. We have now extended these observations by examining plates exposed in the Bolivian Andes at a height of 5,500 m., and have found, in all, forty examples of the process leading to the production of secondary mesons. In eleven of these, the secondary particle is brought to rest in the emulsion so that its range can be determined. In Part 1 of this article, the measurements made on these tracks are described, and it is shown that they provide evidence for the existence of mesons of different mass. In Part 2, we present further evidence on the production of mesons, which allows us to show that many of the observed mesons are locally generated in the `explosive' disintegration of nuclei, and to discuss the relationship of the different types of mesons observed in photographic plates to the penetrating component of the cosmic radiation investigated in experiments with Wilson chambers and counters.},
