abstract = "Hard (infinitely hard) and soft (Yukawa) core potentials have been fit to Yale and Livermore phase parameters and low-energy data. The potentials are local and static except that a different one is used for each state of distinct isotopic spin, total spin, and total angular momentum. It is found that neither the short-range behavior of the potentials nor the central-to-tensor ratio in the 3S1-3D1 state is well determined by the data. Present data do exclude potentials containing only local central, tensor, and spin-orbit terms. Addition of a quadratic spin-orbit potential such as that used by the Yale group or by Hamada and Johnston helps greatly but is probably not enough to completely reproduce the data. Nevertheless, present day theories which use potentials are not likely to be sensitive to failures due to use of this form."
