\section{Results and Discussion}\label{sec:Results}

\subsection{The Square Well Potential}
The square well has an analytical form for the phase shift which can be compared
to the result of VPA. A well with the arbitrary depth of \SI{4}{MeV} is used as
example, with the computed curves shown in~\cref{fig:squarewell}. The curves
overlap, but the analytical solution
has a jump at \(\approx 2.8\) MeV, stemming from the inherent modulo \(\pi\)
ambiguity. The transformation \(k\cot\delta\) lifts this ambiguity while fixing
the phase shift to \(0\) at \(k=0\), plotted in the lower panel of the figure.
Once transformed the curves overlap perfectly, as expected.

  in the analytical solution is lifted in the lower panel with the
  transformation \(k\cot{\delta_{0}}\), showing a perfect overlap.}
\end{figure}

The simple form the square well potential allows us to illustrate some general
behaviors of the phase shift. The phase shifts produced by several
different well depths are plotted
in~\cref{fig:squarewellwave} together with the corresponding cross sections 
in the lower panel. As \(k\to 0\), all curves approach an integral multiple of
\(\pi\), and decrease towards zero as \(k\to \infty\). As
Levinson's theorem dictates, the multiple of \(\pi\) corresponds to the number
of bound states each well can contain, with
the number of states increasing as the potential depth increases.

For some particular well depths, the cross sections shot up beyond the limits of
the plot. The phase shift curves too have a
characteristic shape, rising rapidly near \(k=0\). Examples are marked by dashed lines. Such curves indicate that the
potential is on verge of allowing for an additional bound state. [cont]

A related phenomenon happens where the phase shift crosses \(\delta=\pi\), at
which point the cross section falls off to zero. This is more
clearly demonstrated in~\cref{fig:pizero}. A phase shift of \(n\pi\) means the wave inside
the well has precisely \(n\) more oscillations than the free wave. When the scattered
wave exits the potential, it is exactly in phase with the free wave, and hence
indistinguishable. If the higher \(l>0\) waves are negligible in the same region,
the potential causes no scattering at all. This is the cause for the
\textit{Ramsauer-Townsend effect}\cite[p.~195]{taylor}, where certain gases are completely
transparent for electrons at a given energy.

    zero due to the potential becoming negligible. As the wells deepen,

    starting at multiples of \(\pi\). The dashed lines show the zero energy peaks.}

    apparent.}
\end{figure}

For completeness sake, the phase shift is found for positive wells, see~\cref{fig:positivesquare}. We expect there to be no bound states, and for
the phase shift to be negative. This is indeed the case, as the figure shows.
The step-like behavior is due to the [cont. Skip this section? Kinda obvious.
Well, the step behavior is not, but is also not interesting.].

\subsubsection{K-Matrix}
The phase shifts for the \(^{1}S_{0}\) partial wave of \(np\)-scattering
obtained through the K-matrix method is shown 
in~\cref{fig:kmatrix}. This is compared to experimental data from the Nijmegen
group\cite{PhysRevC.48.792}, also shown in the same figure. There is generally a
good agreement, with all features of the experimental data being replicated; a
rapid rise from 0 to \(\approx 60\degree\), followed by a fall and a sign flip
at \mbox{\(\approx 250\) MeV}. However, the computed phase shift is consistently lower
than the experimental, until they cross.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{Figures/kmatrix.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:kmatrix}Phase shift for \(^{1}S_{0}\) partial wave of
    \(np\)-scattering, both experimental data from\cite{PhysRevC.48.792}
     (\(nijm93\)) and from K-matrix calculations. There is good agreement, but the
  calculated phase shift is consistently lower than the experimental
  values. 30 mesh points were used in the calculation for each phase shift point.}
\end{figure}

The accuracy of the K-matrix calculations depends on the number of mesh points
used. To determine its influence, the Nijmegen data was interpolated with linear
interpolation, and compared to K-matrix calculations using different mesh sizes.
The comparison was made by taking the total mean square error (MSE).
See~\cref{fig:kmatrix_accuracy}. As the shape of the curve remains fairly
consistent, the MSE of the region \(0\le T_{\text{lab}} \le 150\) MeV was chosen as
representative of the ``total'' MSE. This is mainly done to avoid the crossing
which slightly complicates the error comparison.

Unsurprisingly, the MSE starts off jumping before quickly falling off to a
minimum at about \(25\) mesh points.  As the MSE converges with just a few mesh points, the
discrepancy observed in~\cref{fig:kmatrix} can not be attributed to the method
itself. Increasing the number further gives
negligible improvements. There is, however, an increasing cost in computational
resources.


\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{Figures/kmatrix_accuracy}
  \caption{\label{fig:kmatrix_accuracy}The accuracy of the K-Matrix method as a
  function of number of mesh points. For \(n>20\), the error remains near
  constant. 150 phase shifts were calculated for energies \(0\le T_{\text{lab}} \le 150\).}
\end{figure}

The total computation time and amount of allocated bytes used by the K-matrix
method is shown in~\cref{fig:kmatrix_measurements}. As discussed
in~\cref{sec:discret}, both the time and the memory is expected to increase by roughly
\(\mathcal{O}(N^{2})\). Fitting second degree polynomials, we see that this is
indeed roughly the case, with the required time being slightly chaotic. The
time was measured by repeating each calculation ten times and taking the median.

There is therefore a trade off between the resources required for a calculation
and the accuracy obtained, a trade off which quickly gets increasingly poor,
as no further benefit is obtained after \(\approx 25\) mesh points.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{Figures/kmatrix_measurements.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:kmatrix_measurements}Resource usage of the K-matrix
    method as a function of number of mesh points. The time shows the median of
    \(10\) repetitions.}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{VPA}

The second method for obtaining the phase shift from the Reid potential is the
variable phase approach. The results are compared with the Nijmegen data
in~\cref{fig:vpa}, and not unexpectedly, it gives very similar results
as~\cref{fig:kmatrix}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{Figures/vpa.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:vpa}The resulting \(S\)-wave phase shift from variable
    phase approach alongside experimental data.}
\end{figure}

VPA requires the cut-off of the potential to be sufficiently close to infinity
to make the error negligible. Cutting off too quickly can be computationally
beneficial, so there is one more a trade off between accuracy and resource
usage. The resulting phase shifts from different cut-off points are shown
in~\cref{fig:rend}. When the cut-off is too small, the potential is effectively
a repulsive potential, hence giving a negative phase shift. The phase shift gets
increasingly negative as the interaction ``sees'' more of the repulsive region,
but once the attractive region is included, the phase shift quickly increases
and converges to the far-away solution (\(r_{\text{end}}=15\)).


\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{Figures/rend.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:rend}The effect of using different cut off points
    \(r_{\mathrm{end}}\) of the potential. Note how the different cut off points
    correspond to the different radii of~\cref{fig:reid}.}
\end{figure}

The resource usage of VPA is significantly more difficult to measure, as the
differential equation is solved by the external package
\textrm{DifferentialEq.jl}, allowing for a range of different parameters and
methods. For completeness sake, the MSE, time and memory usage as a function of
the step size is shown in the appendix~\cref{fig:vpa_measurements}. The
interesting information is that the time is nearly constant at \(\approx 0.2\)
seconds for the same number of phase shift points as the K-matrix method solved
in~\cref{fig:kmatrix_measurements}. The K-matrix method is therefore
significantly faster, with no loss in accuracy.


\subsubsection{Comparison \& Exploration}

The phase shift from both K-matrix calculations and VPA are plotted together
in~\cref{fig:vpa_matrix_compare} alongside the experimental data. The pointwise
relative error is shown in the lower panel, having a parabolic shape. The
theoretical points are perfectly overlapping. Since we already know that VPA
is in agreement with the analytical solutions of the square well, we have
confidence that the K-matrix method too is correctly implemented.


\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{Figures/vpa_kmatrix_compare.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:vpa_matrix_compare}The results of K-matrix and VPA using
    good parameters, compared to the \(nijm93\) data. The relative error is
    shown in the lower panel. Only \mbox{\(1 < T_{\mathrm{lab}} < 100\)} MeV are
    included; an arbitrary choice to exclude the jump at \(\approx 0.1 \) MeV
    and the crossing near \(250\) MeV.}
\end{figure}

As the
discrepancy between the theoretical computations and the experimental data can
be attributed to neither the parameters of the methods nor the methods
themselves, the culprit must be the model. The Reid potential was fitted to
\(np\)-scattering data from the \(60\)s and earlier, while the Nijmegen data is
more complete and obtained from more accurate methods.

% \end{figure}

The phase shift curve of the Reid potential has a striking resemblance to the
dashed curves of~\cref{fig:squarewellwave}. From our earlier discussion, it is
easy to suspect
there to be a bound state if the potential was just slightly more
attractive. To examine this, the second term of the Reid potential was increased
by a few percent, yielding the phase shift curves of~\cref{fig:changeV2}. At
\(+3.37\%\) its strength, the phase shift at \(k=0\) jumps up to \(180\degree\),
allowing for a bound state by Levinson's theorem.

  Reid potential more attractive by increasing the strength of its second term

  value. At a \(3.37\%\) increase, the curves no longer begin at \(0\degree\),
  but jump to \(180\degree\). This is marked by a dashed line. The apparent lower start point is due to numerical
inaccuracy.}
