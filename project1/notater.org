Wavefunction asymptotically vanish at long range.

Scattering states are dictated (?) by boundary conditions on incoming and outgoing part.

Lippmann-Schwinger equation is most convenient to describe scattering states.

Cross sections can be obtained from experiments
 - Related to phase shift of scattered particles.
 - 
Phase shift is a bridge between theory and experiments.

Phase shifts are related to the R-matrix.
 - R-matrix obtained from LS equation
 - Principal value of R-matrix can cause divergence
   and matrix manipulation is difficult for large dimensions.
 - Variable Phase approach can obtain phase shift by integrating diff equation, 
   - limited to local potential without tensor interaction

1S0 state of nucleon-nucleon scattering

* Oppgaven

 - Goal to solve LP for two interacting nucleons and
 relate the obtained phase shifts with those extracted from experimental cross
 section.
- Models a proton - neutron interaction with a parametrized potential
 for partial wave 1S0, Spin = 0, orbital momentum = 0, a singlet S-state.

- Reid potential
- Derivation of LS
- Scattering states, E > 0
- Gives a reaction matrix
- E = k0^2/m
- P indicates Cauchy principal value prescription to avoid singularities
- Solve LS in momentum space
- Need to transform the potential to momentum space through a Hankel Transform
- Transforms Reid
- Remove P by a trick
- Obtain the reaction matrix by discretizing and iterate
- Compare to paper
- VPA limited to to local potentials (d(r-r')V(r) = <r'|V|r>) and
  without tensor forces.
- Implement VPA and show that it reproduces phase shifts for the square well.
- Apply VPA to Reid for proton-neutron scattering (nucleon-nucleon?)
- Show from equation that attractive potential gives positive phase shift
  and repulsive gives negative. 
- S-wave phase shifts change from positive to negative values at Elab = 270 MeV
  in 1S0 partial wave (why??) imply a strong short-range repulsion for local NN
  potentials. 
- VPA has Levinson's theorem built in. Show how.

* Oppsummering
  
  Potential in momentum space. Parametrized potential between a proton and neutron for
the partial wave 1S0, spin S = 0, orbital momentum l = 0, singlet S state. This
state has no bound state for the deuteron. 

- Find the potential in momentum Space
- Evaluate the phase shifts
  - Compare to Nijmegen group
Variable phase approach, consider only S-waves
- Show that a fully attractive potential gives a positive phase shift, repulsive
  a negative.
- VPA builds in Levinson's theorem. Why?

* Oppgaven 1.0
 - Lippmann-Schwinger describes scattering states
 - Cross sections are related to phase shifts of the scattered particles
 - Phase shift related to R-matrix
   - Obtained from LS.
 - Variable phase approach more limited.
 - Utled R-Matrix
 - Uteld VPA
 - Exponential potential
 - Square well potential
 - Transform til momentum space
 - Both methods used to calculate the phase shift at different scattering energies
 - Plot:
   - Phase shift vs kinetic energy in lab frame
     - Both R-Matrix and VPA
     - delta / deg vs T_lab / MeV
 - Maximum phase shift at about 61 deg when E_lab = 6 MeV
 - 0 at 250 MeV
 - No resonances or bound states
 - Analytical solurtion for phase shift delta-k for Square Well
   - Mismatch due to multiplicity of function f(x) = cot(x)
   - Does not affect the result
   - k*cot(delta(k)) vs k, delta(k) vs k
   - Rmax = 5.0, R = 1 fm, V0 = 4.0 fm-1
 - sinÂ²(x) > 0 always hold => V0 positive => phase shift decrease for increasing r
   - hence, fully attractive potential gives positive phase shift, repulsive gives negative
 - max(VPA) = 2MV/k. As k-> inf, this -> 0. Integration yields d(k_inf) = 0.
   - At sufficient energies, the high speed proton travels so fast it doesn't feel the potential.
 - In Levinson's theorem: delta(k=1) - delta(k_inf) = n\pi
   - d(0) = n\pi
 - Plots:
   - Phase shifts for square well at differnt depths. Depths adjusted near threshold where first bound state emerges
   - Phase shift increase sharply and exceeds 3.14 at V0 = 1.24 fm^-1.
     - First bound state
